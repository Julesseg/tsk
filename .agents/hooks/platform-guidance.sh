ENV=LOCAL MAC. Xcode is available, so UI tests can run locally when useful.
`cd Core && swift test` remains the fast loop and CI is the full UI gate. For
UI tests, boot a simulator you own, then run:
  cd App && xcodebuild test -project MyApp.xcodeproj -scheme MyApp \
    -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,id=<booted-udid>' CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED=NO
Shut down any simulator you booted when verification finishes.
